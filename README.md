# codeChallengeAiden
## 1A bucket challenge:
Open the terminal, when call ___python bucketChallenge.py___, you shall give the parameters in the following format:
<br/>
1. At the first line, your entries are bucket sizes.
2. At the second line, type in the target size.
<br/><br/>
e.g.
<br/> _INPUT:_
<br/> 4 5 6
<br/> 7
<br/> _OUTPUT:_
<br/> 0

## 1B phone number:
In __num2words.html__, you will see an input box that allows you to enter your phone number.
<br/>
After clicking on button "convert", the transformed words would show as a pop-up window, 
<br/> (Or you can modify the code so that the output will be in the output box)
<br/> The transformation rule is to the left of the input box and for the sake of convenience 
<br/> we only allow ten predisgnated words of length 3 to be transformed.
<br/> The output would be the transformed words, if any, plus the transformed letter of the numbers
<br/> and it is convenient for you to associate the letters that do not form words yet with your favorite words.
<br/><br/>
e.g.
<br/> _INPUT_:
<br/> 3333450000
<br/> _OUTPUT_:
<br/> mummy Mrs zzzz
<br/> With these words and letters, you can associate to a scenario in where a female mummy is sleeping.

## 2 file challenge:
Assume the input file would be txt files ("*.txt").
<br/> Our output would also be a txt file in which the quantifier and names are alinged in a desired format.
<br/> Besides, __file1.txt__ and __file2.txt__ are two examples of input file 
<br/> __target.txt__ is the output file where we will generate desired format.
<br/> Note that you can change the names of input files in __fileChallenge.py__
